                        <p>
                            My path in programming began with curiosity and has evolved into a passion for creating
                            meaningful digital experiences. Starting with HTML and CSS, I've expanded my expertise
                            to include modern frameworks and tools that enable me to build comprehensive web solutions.
                        </p>

                    <div className="my-vision">
                        <h2>My Vision</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe in the power of clean, efficient code and user-centered design. My goal is to
                            create applications that not only function flawlessly but also provide intuitive and
                            engaging experiences. I'm committed to continuous learning and staying current with
                            emerging technologies.
