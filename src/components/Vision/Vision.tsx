        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Originally, my career took root in education, working at a university for many years.
          But my intrinsic desire to innovate and see tangible results led me to transition into IT.
          Over the past year, I've immersed myself in frontend development and found deep satisfaction
          in this ever-evolving creative field.
